# Intent

Prompts, context, and model outputs are data. They are handled with a defined
purpose, protected like other sensitive data, and not copied into places
(such as logs) where they escape those controls.

# Clause

ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Annex A, control group A.7 (Data for AI systems). Clause id
and group name only; the standard's text is not reproduced here.
