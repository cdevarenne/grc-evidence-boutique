# Intent

A high-risk system records events automatically, so its operation can be
traced after the fact. The records themselves must be protected.

# Scope

Applies to high-risk AI systems only (Chapter III). The risk tier declared in
the AI inventory decides: at any other tier this article reports
`not-applicable`.

# Source

[Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, Article 12](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj) (paraphrased).
