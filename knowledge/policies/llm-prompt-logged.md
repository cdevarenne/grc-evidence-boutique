# Rule

A logger call whose argument is a prompt or a completion copies user input and
model output into the log pipeline, where retention and access rules for that
data no longer hold.

# Satisfies

- [A.7 — Data for AI systems](../controls/iso42001/a.7.md)
- [Art. 12 — Record-keeping](../controls/eu-ai-act/art-12.md): logging is expected, but the records must be protected; high-risk only

# Enforced at

- Semgrep in CI, using the vendored ruleset in `policies/semgrep/`

# Remediation

Log a request id and a hash of the prompt, not the prompt or the completion.
Keep full transcripts, if needed, in a store with its own access control and retention.
