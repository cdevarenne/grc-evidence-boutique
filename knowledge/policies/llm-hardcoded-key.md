# Rule

A string literal assigned to an `*_API_KEY` name, or passed as an `*api_key`
argument (for example `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(google_api_key="...")`), puts a
credential in source control, where anyone with read access can use it.

# Satisfies

- [CC6.1 — Logical Access](../controls/cc6.1.md)
- [A.6 — AI system life cycle](../controls/iso42001/a.6.md)

# Enforced at

- Semgrep in CI, using the vendored ruleset in `policies/semgrep/`

# Remediation

Read the key from the environment (for example `os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]`)
or a secret manager, and rotate any key that was committed.
