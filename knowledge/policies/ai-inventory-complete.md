# Rule

The AI inventory (`ai-inventory.yaml` under the scan target) lists every component with its kind and every
inventoried AI system. A component of kind `assistant` with no system entry is
an AI feature the organization does not govern.

# Satisfies

- [A.4 — Resources for AI systems](../controls/iso42001/a.4.md)

# Enforced at

- Conftest in CI, reading the AI inventory

# Remediation

Add a `systems` entry for the component with its owner, model provider, and
purpose, then review its risk tier.
